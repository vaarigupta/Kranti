            Amrin

            My name is Amrin and I am 15 years old. I never went to school because I am deaf and mute and nobody knew a school for deaf children. Today because of Kranti I am studying in USA in very good school where they take care of me and teach me things that I have never learned before. I never thought my dreams will come true and I will have chances to learn things. I am really grateful for Kranti and for each and every person my life who helped me to reach my goals and achieve my dream. I can't thank enough to anyone who supported me for my achievements. Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for being the most amazing people in my life.

            Ashi 


            Hello!! This is Asmita Katti and I'm going to turn 20 in November, but everyone says to me you look like a little kid. One time I went to the bank to deposit some money and the bank teller said to me "no children, please send your parents." :( . I still don't know what do next in life? From last 1 and half years I have been focusing on myself like working on therapy and also practicing Mindfulness. On the other hand, I was working with "GHAR BACHAO GHAR BANAO AANDHOLAN" which works for housing rights in slum areas. And now I'm looking forward to work with special needs kids. I love to spend time with them, but I need to take some courses first. Someday I'm planning to move to other city like Delhi, Kashmir, I don't know exactly, still working on it. Hope I will figure it out as soon!

            Ashwini

            Hello everyone!! I'm Ashwini. It's been 2 years in Kranti and that was the most wonderful years of my life. Right now I'm in New York studying in college of New Rochelle. It’s been just two months in New York. The start was very difficult for me, but now I'm ok! To reach till this point it was all possible because of all the people who supported me without even knowing me. I want to be an art therapist not only because I love art, but art helps me to  express myself. I want to reach out to people through art because there are many people like me who can't express themselves through words. I have seen many nice and wonderful people in my life and they have given me a lot and I want to give to the world what I have got.

              Danish

              Hi my name is Danish! I just started my university at the University of the West in LA. Since I was at Kranti I got to know more about therapy, and I took therapy for past 3 years. This has really shaped my life so much, because while growing up I carried lots of my negative past experiences with me, but after therapy it helped me to remind myself this doesn’t serve me and I have to do my best to let it go and focus on something more positive. Being able to understand about therapy at such young age I found myself end up studying psychology. Studying abroad for my bachelor’s degree is challenging but I am also grateful for the people  and Kranti who have helping me to have such beneficial education experience in the USA.

              Kavita 

              Hello Everyone, My name is Kavita, I am 23 years old. My favourite person in this world is my Dadi (grandmother). She has given me her whole life to be a better person. My best friends are so many because I feel every individual is best in their own way. I have been at Kranti for almost 4 beautiful years. These years have brought lot of growth and learnings to me, different types of life skills, confidence, learned the meaning of success, got a beautiful Kranti family and explored the world and got a whole different perspective of life from different experiences. I have a few hobbies which include talking to my friends, drawing, singing and now there is one more I have discovered, a new one is to listen to people, and I swear it has changed my life :). Right now I am in Bangalore with Sheetal, soon we are going to intern at M.A.D. non-profit organisation  (Make A Difference) for 6 months. We are very excited and pretty nervous at the same time, because both of us had worked but in different sectors and this is going to be different. It's a very big opportunity for us to learn and develop different types of skills which will help us in future to work.

                Rani


                Hi! My name is Jayashree but my dad used to call me Rani which means queen, so most of the people who know me very well they also call me Rani. Right now I'm seventeen and I have lots of problems in my life for example so many people make me to think about my future.
                As all the teenagers I have so many dreams but my purpose of life is laughing and eating all the time. At the same time I love to share my smile my laugh my happiness and my food with everyone! My favourite food is pizza, so whenever someone comes like donors or Robin’s friends and they ask what I want, I always say I want pizza! Actually I love alllll food, but I especially love pizza, burgers and chicken. When it was Bani didi’s birthday, we went to a mall. I ate two burgers, two boxes of French fries and one bucket of chicken all by myself. Then when we got home I ate some more. Whenever someone brings bananas to Kranti, all the girls hide them because if they do not save for themselves, I will eat ten or twelve bananas in one day! Maybe I should not be an actress – I should find a job where I can eat all day!

I finished my high school in 2015 and took two years of gap to decide what I actually want to do. During the gap year I traveled around India and took different workshops about Social Justice, theatre, etc. I also did internship with an organization called Ashoka Innovations for public in Bangalore where I learnt a lot and was also preparing myself for university. As during my gap year I started falling in love with theatre I wanted to major in theatre with psychology. Right now I am in New York in an amazing university Wagner College and already finished my first semester successfully. I really loved my campus and New York, I just get frozen sometimes because of cold and snow otherwise I am enjoying and learning a lot in this process. Currently I am Undergraduate undeclared major student but I think I want major in Forensic psychology and do minor in Theatre.

              Sheetal 

              Hey! I am Sheetal. My full name is Sheetal Jain, usually I don't like to say my full name because I believe mothers' names should be given to children not fathers' names because I never met my father. I'm 23 and right now I'm interning with Make a Difference organization. Before this I learned an African instrument called Dejmbe with company called Taal Inc. where I was a drum circle facilitator. I did this after I was in Washington DC to learn drum kit! I like giving speech about social justice issues, talking to people about human rights, doing theater/drama about our life stories, some workshops about sex education, and playing drums. Before coming to Kranti, I never thought I can do these things. I love to travel to see new place, to meet new people and talk with them. Anyway, I like allll of these things, but I still do not know for certain what to do with my life. If you have any suggestion, please tell me. :)

              Hi! My name is Shraddha Katti but everyone calls me Shaa because my name is too long to pronounce. I'm 17 years old. I see myself in future as an artist. What’s interesting about me is I love to sketch/paint Buddha, whenever I make Buddha it expresses my feelings. I really enjoy listening to songs. I like to enjoy my own company, usually I am shy. I have a small number of friends in my friend list, but most of the people say that I'm one of the best friends in their friend list!

                Shweta 

                Possibilities is what defines my life. What possibility was there that a dark skinned dalit girl who grew up in red light community to ever set foot on a foreign land to study? I remember day dreaming to escape my reality when I was young, one time I day dreamed of traveling to Amrika, very obviously inspired by Bollywood movies where the protagonists would return after finishing their studies in foreign country. Thinking the society would give me more respect and value if only I went abroad cause I had none growing up. I also remember sneaking into other people's houses when the English channel would play Harry Potter in Hindi but never watching the whole in the hopes of reading Harry Potter books one day in English or Hindi, didn't matter caused I loved reading. 

                What was a wild possibility two very important dreams of mine would come true one day? They did. I came to Kranti very determined to finish my 12th grade and when Katie our former staff brought all the Harry Potter books, I would stay up till 5am reading the book. Robin literally had to hide all the books to force me to study for my final exams. Yes, I did finish my 12th and took a gap year during that year Kranti asked if I would like to study in the US. I applied and guess what I got admission with full tuition scholarship. My departure from India was as dramatic as Bollywood, I was all packed and ready to fly the night before, my flight was at 9:45am the next day but guess what I didn't have my visa. My passport was still at the US consulate. I wasn't sure if I was actually gonna make it, Kranti and my whole family took my luggage to the airport, Robin and I rushed to the consulate early in morning. And the Visa officer was standing outside holding my passport with my visa, I am very grateful for him for literally coming out and handing me my passport so I don't miss my flight. It was already 8:15am I was still unsure if I would board that flight. Luckily, we had the best auto driver who flew us to the Mumbai international airport and yes, I made it.

                I can't what other possibilities are yet to take place!

                Sumaiya

                Hello!! This is Sumaiya but everyone calls me Sum at Kranti. My hobbies are drums, cycling and piano, these three are my favourite things to do on my free time. Last year I participated in a camp for cycling in Manali. I want to be a journalist. When I first came to Kranti I used to take lightly about being a journalist, but as time passed I realised this is my dream. It will take me a long time to become a journalist because I am finishing my school, I am 15 only. When I go to university I definitely choose media as a subject. I love studying but only if someone teaching me, otherwise I get distracted really soon!! Most important fact about me is that I really love eating I'm foodie person, the one thing I cannot live without it. Everywhere I travel with Kranti, from Kashmir to Kerala, I taste the pani puri. My favourite so far was in Bhutan, one day I ate 10 plates! I can eat just pani puri from day to night, breakfast, lunch and dinner!

                Taniya

                People call me Taniya!! But I call myself beautiful. That’s who I am. Hello everyone, I was born in Kolkata. I don't know who was my father but I'm really curious to see him once. Right now 
                I'm 21 and I just finished my12th. In the chapters of my life I have faced so many interesting pages, some was inspired some was sad, some was very scary, but some was very happy too. But I think that's the lesson of my life. I have learned so many things, but the most important and wonderful thing that I learned from life is to love yourself no matter what the situation is. After coming to Kranti I have learned so many things about life and the most important was how to live a happy life, and that's what makes me a strong woman. I love to dance for happiness because it make me smile. I want to be a flight attendant and at the same time I want to be a zumba trainer. The most interesting things about me is to I like to makes people laugh and bring a big smile on face. One person whom I love the most is my lovely sister Mahek, I will do anything for her 😊
